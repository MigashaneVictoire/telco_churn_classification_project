## PLAN

- create all the files I will need to fund a funcitoning project
- create a .gitignore file and ignore my env.py file
- start by acquiring data from the codeup database and document all my initail aquisition code in the acquire.py file
- using the prepare file, I will clearn my data and split it into train, validatate, and test sets
- then I will explore my data. Here it is important I focus on my main two questions which are:
    - Are customers with DSL more or less likely to churn?
    - What month are customers most likely to churn and does that depend on their contract type?

- anser all my quesitons with stat test
- make prediction of customer churn using my questions.
- document findings (include 4 visuals)
    - add important finding to the final notebook
    - create csv file of findings of model.
